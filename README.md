## Prediction testing for Early Warning Signals

This repository contains code to test a set of Early Warning Signals for tipping points in complex systems. These tests were conduced for the MSc course _Econometric Research_ at the Free University of Amsterdam. This repository is constructed as follows:

* `src/simulations.py`: this file contains the code to simulate the dynamical systems.
* `src/tests.py`: this file contains the code to test prediction results.
